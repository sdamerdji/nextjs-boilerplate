RECOMMENDED FINDINGS
Special Development Permit
Goals and Policies that relate to this project are:
Land Use and Transportation Element
POLICY LT-4.2 Encourage nodes of interest and activity, public open spaces, well
planned development, mixed-use projects, signature commercial uses, and buildings
and other desirable uses, locations, and physical attractions.
GOAL LT-11 Facilitate an economic development environment that supports a wide
variety of businesses and promotes a strong economy within existing environmental,
social, fiscal, and land use constraints.
POLICY LT-12.6 Create a strong, identifiable Downtown that offers regional and
citywide shopping opportunities and entertainment.
POLICY LT-13.6 Support a regional commercial district in Downtown Sunnyvale.
1. The proposed use attains the objectives and purposes of the General Plan of the
City of Sunnyvale. Finding met
It is common to request full alcohol sale and service with food establishments,
especially in such an active downtown setting with a mix of retail, office and
residential uses. The addition of an outdoor covered patio enhances the vibrancy
of downtown, fostering a lively and inviting atmosphere for both residents and
visitors and supports the commercial downtown. Therefore, the proposed project
is consistent with the General Plan goals and policies listed above.
2. The proposed use ensures that the general appearance of proposed structures, or
the uses to be made of the property to which the application refers, will not impair
either the orderly development of, or the existing uses being made of, adjacent
properties. Finding met
The proposed covered patio consists of opaque glass panels and light gauge metal
frame, metal columns, and decorative plants enclosed by a concrete base, which
complements the design of the existing building. The Department of Public Safety
reviewed the proposed project and found no concerns. The proposed food
establishment is located at the courtyard of the building, approximately two and
three blocks away from the closest single-family homes. In addition, there would
be adequate parking for the proposed project. Therefore, staff finds neighborhood
impacts to be minimal.`,
